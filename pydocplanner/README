This folder contains the source code used for this project. There are 5 files:

- documentplanner.py is the main module which contains the Bottom-Up planning method and necessary classes
- weather_test.py is the script to test the WeatherExplainer example
- assess_test.py is the script to test the ASSESS example, and contains the simple Content Selector
- util.py includes various utility methods used by the other scripts
- MyTree.py is a module file used by ASSESS

NLTK must be installed in order to run these scripts. The two data files needed for the ASSESS test are in the 'data' folder.

To run the two test scripts, the following commands are used:


>python weather_test.py
>python assess_test.py
